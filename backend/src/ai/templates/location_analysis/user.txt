Analyze this image of a storage space and identify its structure.

Provide your response as a JSON object with this exact structure:
{
  "parent": {
    "name": "descriptive name for the main container",
    "location_type": "one of: room, shelf, bin, drawer, box, cabinet",
    "description": "brief description of the storage unit"
  },
  "children": [
    {
      "name": "descriptive name for compartment",
      "location_type": "one of: room, shelf, bin, drawer, box, cabinet",
      "description": "brief description"
    }
  ],
  "confidence": 0.0 to 1.0 (calibrate honestly per system instructions - do NOT default to 0.95),
  "reasoning": "explanation of what you identified and why"
}

Guidelines:
- For drawers, name them systematically (e.g., "Drawer 1", "Drawer 2" or "Top Left Drawer", "Top Right Drawer")
- For shelves, number from top to bottom or use descriptive names
- For bins/compartments, use grid naming if applicable (e.g., "A1", "A2", "B1", "B2")
- Include ALL visible compartments in the children array
- If no compartments are visible, return an empty children array

Remember: Confidence should reflect how clearly the storage structure and compartments are visible. Reserve 0.95+ only for crystal-clear images with all compartments fully visible.

Respond ONLY with the JSON object, no additional text.
