Analyze this image and identify the item(s) shown.

Provide your response as a JSON object with this exact structure:
{
  "identified_name": "specific item name",
  "confidence": 0.0 to 1.0 (calibrate honestly per system instructions - do NOT default to 0.95),
  "category_path": "Top > Middle > Bottom",
  "description": "brief description of the item and its common uses",
  "specifications": {
    "key": "value"
  },
  "alternative_suggestions": [
    {"name": "alternative name", "confidence": 0.0 to 1.0}
  ],
  "quantity_estimate": "approximate count if multiple items visible"
}

Remember: Confidence should reflect actual certainty based on image quality and distinguishing features. Reserve 0.95+ only for items with clearly visible labels or unmistakable identification.

Respond ONLY with the JSON object, no additional text.
